Recommendations
===============

The recommended Operating System is RHEL 6.x or Centos 6.x.

Recommended Hadoop Release is Cloudera Manager 5.5 with Accumulo 1.7 Parcel and Service installed. See http://www.cloudera.com/documentation/other/accumulo/latest/PDF/Apache-Accumulo-Installation-Guide.pdf for more details.

Infrastructure and Software
---------------------------

Koverse and the open source software it leverages must be run on a system with no less than 10 GB of memory.
For workloads beyond simple examples and testing we recommend a properly provisioned Hadoop cluster with five or more nodes.

Using the Cloudera QuickStart VM is not recommended.
