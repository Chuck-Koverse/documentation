Introduction
^^^^^^^^^^^^

Organizations are likely to require some custom software development to address their own unique set of data analytics requirements.
These custom software features will require their own unique sources and methods that provide strategic insight and competitive advantage.

Each organization could have potentially some combination of unique data sets, mission-specific data processing requirement used to analyze and transform those data sets, and custom interactive user interfaces.

With this in mind, Koverse provides this developer documentation describing how to programmatically extend Koverse with additional functionality, and how to deploy that functionality into an operational Koverse instance.

There are three main categories of custom development on Koverse:
1. Build a web application
2. Create custom analytics
3. Integrate Koverse with custom data sources, authentication systems, and downstream data consumer services
