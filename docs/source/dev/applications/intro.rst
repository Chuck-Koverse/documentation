Applications API

Koverse is unique in bringing together access control, scalable analytics, and ubiquitous indexing into a single platform. These three things are all needed to put data-driven business solutions into production.

A data-driven solution will need the access control required to protect sensitive data, analytics to extract valuable insight, and indexing in order to deliver analytical results to a large number of decision makers quickly.
Without all three of these solutions can stagnate in the development phase indefinitely.

End-user facing applications built on Koverse can be written using a variety of web-based technologies that communicate to Koverse through a REST API.
The Koverse REST API includes methods for issuing queries against any and all analytical results according to data access policies.


The `REST API methods

Follow this example to see how an application can be built on Koverse.
