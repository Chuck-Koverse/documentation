Use Cases

General Use Cases
-----------------
**Compliance:** The past few years have given rise to a nearly countless number of government and industry regulations that organizations must adhere to. In the financial area there is Sarbanes-Oxley (SOX) and Dodd-Frank. Health care has given us HIPAA. Web sites that handle sensitive or payment data need to follow PCI DSS. Compliance with these regulations requires organizations to have visibility into many parts of the business. This level of visibility is only possible when the organization can access and process a wide range of data generated by every employee, every application, and every customer-facing activity - and convert that into straightforward summarizations that address specific compliance issues. Koverse gives organizations the access, visibility, and analytic capabilities they need to generate these summaries in a secure and controlled manner, resulting in clear and more complete answers to compliance questions in less time. 

 
**Organizational Knowledge-base:** Organizational data is generated by many users using multiple applications. To further complicate matters users may not be members of the organization. Consider comments to user forums or blog posts, customer emails, and Tweets that are captured for future use. Koverse provides the flexibility needed to search across all organizational data without being restricted by structured vocabularies. This means users are more likely to find the sum total of the information they need to answer questions and make decisions. 

 
**Cross-organizational Information Sharing:** Groups within organizations create their own data. To achieve strategic objectives, different groups are frequently required to share information. While necessary, this is not always easy. Existing database technologies make it difficult to integrate data from different sources, in addition to the fact that they do not adequately address access control and security; some groups may not want to share confidential information such as customer name or credit card number with people from other groups who do not need it. Koverse provides the tools necessary to collocate and selectively share data, yielding significant and new value.

Industry-Specific Use Cases
---------------------------
Pharma
^^^^^^^
Much attention has been given recently to opportunities that may exist in the pharmaceutical industry to take advantage of advanced data analytics and data sharing.  While a lot of this attention is focused on opportunities--and potentially even mandates--for data transparency during the pharmaceutical research and development phase, there is another much-less-mentioned arena of opportunity: The arena of pharmaceutical sales and marketing. 

In every industry, information about customers is invaluable; how to find them, how to reach them, and how to make use of their feedback. Unlike other industries in which the customer is direct, in the pharmaceutical industry, a customer can be one of many indirect entities.  This makes sales and marketing in pharma much more complex.  Luckily, we are in an era where there is more information than ever available to draw upon to understand customer behavior.  

Koverse is the natural place to collect and analyze these massive amounts of data, providing the ability to rapidly consume both structured and unstructured data and perform analysis that would have previously taken months or been impossible; turning data into an advantage.  This has the potential to benefit pharmaceutical companies and patients alike.


**The Koverse advantage in Reaching Prescribers**


Typically, physicians are "deciled" based on their writing patterns and higher deciles (i.e., physicians who prescribe a drug most often) are more aggressively targeted. But what if there is a smarter way to reach the right prescribers?

Koverse can leverage multiple heterogeneous data sets that are available to pharmaceutical companies, including both traditional and nontraditional data sets such as physician prescription data, physician profile data, sales rep activity, census data, and disease statistics.  The combination and analysis of these data sets can shed new light on which prescribers should receive attention.  For example:

* Regional anomalies could highlight patient populations that could be benefitting from a particular drug, but that currently are not.  More attention could then be focused on prescribers in that region.

* Physicians that have characteristics like high prescribers, but are not themselves high prescribers, could present opportunities for education and outreach.  In fact, it may be more important to target prescribers in this category, than to focus on those who are already reliably using a drug.

**The Koverse Advantage in Reaching Patients**

Again, much benefit can be gained by combining data sets in one place and applying advanced analytics on the entire corpus of data.  For example, combining aggregate prescription data and data from wholesalers with census and social network data can help to:

* Discover untapped markets or surprising patient trends.
* Track drug launches, patient referral patterns, drug switches and off-label use, and disease trends and locations.

Koverse can also open up unprecedented new opportunities in data sharing.  Multiple pharma companies can use the same instance of Koverse securely and decide at a very granular level which data to share.  The result is that all parties can mutually benefit from the availability of more data.  For example, pooled data on patient prescriptions and disease states can:

* Detect patients who are prescribed a drug manufactured by one company, but whose disease state or drug side effects indicate that they would benefit from a treatment plan that included drugs produced by multiple companies.

**The Koverse Advantage in Distributor Interactions**

Pharmaceutical manufacturers can realize immense benefits by using Koverse to leverage the massive amounts of electronic transactional data that is gathered from different points in the supply chain.  This can provide visibility into what is happening in the marketplace and how various channels, such as hospital, retail pharmacy, and mail order are performing. Within Koverse, supply chain data can augment more traditional pharma data sets to:

* Show not only how revenue is accruing, but also how specific wholesaler contracts are performing. 
* Provide opportunities to share data with other pharmaceutical manufacturers and/or wholesalers to ensure compliance with inventory management agreements and detect anomalies such as the introduction of counterfeit drugs into the market.   Without Koverses ability to share and integrate data securely, such analyses would not be possible.
