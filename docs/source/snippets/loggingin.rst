Logging in
^^^^^^^^^^

In some production instances of Koverse, authentication is handled automatically by a public key infrastructure or other integrated single-sign on system.
If so, when you first visit the Koverse URL in a browser you will automatically be logged in.
On a system that is using built-in Koverse user and group management, you will see the following login screen:

To login to a newly installed Koverse instance, type in 'admin' for the user name and 'admin' for the password.
Otherwise, login using the username (often your email address) and password that have been provided to you by your administrator.

If your password is incorrect you will see an error.
