Viewing Import Progress
-----------------------

After adding a new data set, you will be navigated to the overview page for the new data set.
If the import is one-time or continuous, within a short time you begin to see progress information for the initial import job.
There are a few follow-on jobs that run after the import completes or after a continuous job has been running for a while, including indexing the data, gathering statistics, and sampling the data.
Progress for these jobs will display until they complete.

Once complete, the view will update to show an overview of the attributes contained within the data set.

Any newly created data set is viewable only by the user that created it.
