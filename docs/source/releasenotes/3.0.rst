3.0 Release Notes
==================

Koverse version 3.0 includes an update to underlying components including Spark, Hadoop, and Kafka.
This will allow customers to use the latest improvements in those components, including a lot more built-in machine learning algorithms in Spark 2.

Speaking of machine learning, developers can now output Spark DenseVectors and SparseVectors directly to a Koverse data set.
This makes it easy to store features for machine learning algorithms and storing machine learning models that consist of vectors.

Koverse 3.0 also features an all-new Transform SDK that makes it easy to create reusable analytics by writing Koverse Transforms that can take advantage of the new APIs in Spark 2, including the DataSet API.
See the new :ref:`AnalyticsAPI` for details.

Developers who are building web applications should note that all of our REST methods have been renamed to be more consistent and now support versioning.
