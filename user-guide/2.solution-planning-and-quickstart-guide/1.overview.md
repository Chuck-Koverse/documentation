# Overview

[TBD: Write this overview LAST based on input from Paul/team on the other sections]

PAUL: This overview section is still under development. A few notes follow FYI. You can add your own input here per your 10/19 mail re: &quot;Why use Koverse?&quot; etc.

Use Koverse to build apps/interfaces…

Koverse vs traditional…

- Disk is cheap (Koverse is built to use a lot of disk)
- No DBA required
- Query-time vs transform analytics

i.e. the Koverse UI can interact with data assets wherever they are
(they are immediately searchable from the Koverse UI)

## Some basic concepts

- records
- attributes
- transforms (= analytics)
- add-ons
- automation
- normalization
- interactive analytics

TBD: Also, talk through the SOLUTIONS that are on the home page
