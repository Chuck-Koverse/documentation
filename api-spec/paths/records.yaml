  description: |
        Get a list of 100 sample records in a data set. Records are guaranteed
        to be selected uniformly at random. If there are less than 100 records
        in a data set then all records in a data set are returned.

        This is useful for allowing apps to
        show an example of a data set's records to users and for calculating
        simple statistics without processing all the records in a data set.
